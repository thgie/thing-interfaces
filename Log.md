Added a first interface prototype, the listing of the _activities_. I tried to include the possibility to change some of the layout parameters, but animation was out of scope for now. That would have taken to much time. I also did not implement a sidebar yet, which should open when an _activity_ is clicked.

It already shows, how difficult such a layout can be without normalizing some of the data. To adhere better to the layout, I choose to use a monospaced font.
