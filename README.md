# Thing Interfaces

## Prototypes
### [Golden Microwave](https://thgie.github.io/thing-interfaces/prototypes/golden-microwave/)

- 1: sort alphabetically
- 2: sort by randomly generated count of activity
- 3: font size by count
- 4: cut long _activities_
- 5: display as list
- 6: display as cloud

### [Hospitable Salesperson](https://thgie.github.io/thing-interfaces/prototypes/hospitable-salesperson/)

Interface with focus on the materials of the archive. These are not included in this repository. The idea was to kind of flip through the various artefacts.
